"""Unified DPLL-style step for sudoku: unit propagation
(threshold deduction) + branching (decision) + status / conflict
detection, all in a single function.

Same function called by both the trainer and the solver.

Deduction is always deterministic threshold (kill if σ(bce) < threshold).
The eval-time `solve()` never passes `orig_y`; the operator is
deterministic at eval automatically.

Decision: pick a multi-alive cell uniformly, softmax-sample one digit
at `temp_decide`, pin that cell to that digit. Monotonic on the chosen
cell — only a chain reset undoes a commit. Runs every round on
`~conflict & ~solved` batch elements; conflict / solved elements pass
through unchanged so the caller can reset / accept them.

Augmentation (`cfg.augment`):
  Per-row dataset-style aug (digit perm + D4 dihedral) applied here
  inside `dpll_step` as a black-box wrapper around the forward +
  deduce + decide pipeline:
    1. Sample fresh per-row aug.
    2. Apply to `state`, `given_mask`, and `orig_y` (if present).
    3. Forward + status + decision all in the augmented frame.
    4. Invert the aug on `new_state` and on `info["deduce_mask"]` before
       returning, so the caller (solve / train) sees canonical-frame
       outputs throughout.
  The aug is bijective on cells and digits, so all booleans (conflict,
  solved, empty-cell, gt_conflict) are frame-invariant — only positional
  things need explicit invert.

  The trainer also needs to do its own grad-tracked forward; for that,
  use `aug_forward()` in `aug.py` with `cfg.augment` so the grad-side
  forward also operates on aug-frame state and trains invariance.

    Inputs are CANONICAL (original-puzzle frame); outputs are likewise
    canonical (`new_state`, `info["deduce_mask"]` inverted before
    return). `out` (model logits) is in the AUGMENTED frame — callers
    that need it for losses must use `info["aug_state"]`,
    `info["aug_given_mask"]`, `info["aug_orig_y"]` to match the frame.

    Always deterministic threshold deduction. `orig_y` is unused by the
    operator itself, but the parameter is retained so callers / aug
    helpers can permute it under the chosen frame for the trainer's grad
    path. Pass `None` if you don't need to track GT under augmentation.

    `n_conflict_cls`, `n_solved`, `deduce_mask`. Each scalar count requires a
    `.item()` call which forces a CPU-GPU sync. When False, only `deduce_mask`
    (a tensor reference, free) is populated; the `.item()` calls are skipped
    entirely. Pass `want_stats=False` from hot paths that don't print
