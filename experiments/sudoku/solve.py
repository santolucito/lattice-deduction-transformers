"""Streaming-queue solver for sudoku.

Maintains a fixed-size active batch of `M = batch_size // n_chains` slots.
Each slot holds one puzzle's `K = n_chains` parallel stochastic chains and
carries its own round counter. The full B = M*K-row batch is forwarded
every iteration; per-slot bookkeeping then decides what happens to each
slot independently.

Slot lifecycle (per iteration of the main forward loop):
  - Forward `dpll_step` on the whole batch (one model call).
  - Freeze rows belonging to wrong-singleton chains and to empty slots
    (those chain rows don't update; we ignore their per-step outputs).
  - For each *active* slot:
      * If any chain just solved correctly  → puzzle accepted, slot evicted.
      * Else, mark wrong-singleton chains as done (frozen until eviction).
      * Reset conflict chains (in this slot only) to that puzzle's original.
      * Increment the slot's round counter.
      * If the slot's round counter ≥ max_rounds, OR all chains are done
        with no correct solve, the puzzle times out and the slot is evicted.
  - Refill every evicted slot with the next puzzle from the queue.
  - Loop until the queue is empty AND no slot is still active.

So there is no global for loop with a single max_rounds — each puzzle gets
its own max_rounds budget, starting fresh when its slot is filled.

Augmentation is handled entirely inside `dpll_step` (see dpll.py).
This file operates strictly in the canonical (original-puzzle) frame —
state, given_mask, ground_truth and `info["deduce_mask"]` are all
canonical, so the soundness/CLS diagnostics and the post-hoc
correctness check are unchanged from the pre-aug code path.

The toggle lives at `cfg.step.augment` (StepConfig.augment).

    `in_puzzle_mask: [P, S] bool` is optional — when provided, only the
    cells where it's True participate in deduce / decide / conflict
    detection / GT-bookkeeping. Cells where it's False are treated as
    "not in this puzzle" (snowflake's covering-grid setup). Sudoku
    leaves this `None` (every cell is in-puzzle).

    `label_fn: (sol, gt) -> (is_correct: bool, label: str) | None` lets
    callers customize the per-puzzle correctness check + log label. When
    `None` (default), uses cell-by-cell argmax equality and labels
    "CORRECT" / "WRONG". Maze passes a function that does BFS path-
    validation and returns labels like "VALID" / "VALID-ALT" / "WRONG".
    The boolean it returns flows into `res.correct` / `res.wrong`; the
    string is what `verbose=True` prints per puzzle.

    `verbose=False` suppresses per-puzzle log lines (use during in-training eval).
